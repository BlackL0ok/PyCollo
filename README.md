# What is
It's python script to read colloscope with a DBB.

## Instruction

You just need to run the 'GUI_Pycollo.py' file with python and have python on your device.
May be I will add more feature, options, and way to execute (like a .exe or .bash)

I am not responsible in case of problems with schedules, rooms and dates.
